# Introduction to Mathematical Programming-Based Error-Correction Decoding

This repository contain the LaTeX sources (to be compiled with LuaLaTeX) of my LP decoding tutorial titled *Introduction to Mathematical Programming-Based Error-Correction Decoding*.

In order to compile the sources by yourself, you need (besides dozens of packages that should be included in every major TeX distribution)

- my [mh_basic](https://github.com/supermihi/latex) package
- the [Fontin Sans](http://www.exljbris.com/fontin.html) typeface

For references, the document uses my group's biblatex database. As that is managed in a different repository, the `bbl` file is included in this repository, so you do not need to run `biber`. An up-to-date compiled version is available on my [homepage](https://www.uni-koblenz-landau.de/de/koblenz/fb3/mathe/mitglieder/helmling/publications).

Comments, bug reports and contributions are welcome any time!
